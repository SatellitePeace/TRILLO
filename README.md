# TRILLO
a personal portfolio project

This is a booking website designed for booking hotels, tours, flights, and renting cars.

Trillo was built from start to finish using

# Css flexbox
# Html
and
#Scss (sassy scss) technologies.
The project also made use of  extensive  css animations and transformations to give the design an edge.

###### Classes and selectors were bult using BEM (Block Element Model)
The 7-1 rule for component based design architecture was applied to make the codes used in developing this project scalable, maintainable, and reuseable.

The Icons were converted to SVG icons using icomoons.
Trillo consists of five pages
#flight page
#tour page
#car rental page
#hotel page
# home page
the sidebar of the trillo automatically moves to the top when the viewport width reduces to 700px.

###The map in the flight page was gotten from google map generator which i used propeties like width and positioning to make responsive.
Images for the project were sourced from #pexels.com

#Responsive design principles using advanced css media queries were used a make the website UI (user interface) and UX (user experience) perfect for users on all screen sizes.
