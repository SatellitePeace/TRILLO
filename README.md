# TRILLO
a personal portfolio project

This is a booking website designed for booking hotels, tours, flights, and renting cars.
Trillo was built from scratch to finish with html css flexbox and Sassy CSS (SCSS).
The Icons were converted to SVG icons using icomoons.
Trillo consists of five pages
#flight page
#tour page
#car rental page
#hotel page
# homepage
the sidebar of the trillo automatically moves to the top when the viewport width reduces to 700px.
at viewport width 700px i also used position:fixed width 100% and top:0 to give the navbar a fixed position.
The map in the flight page was gotten from google map generator which i used propeties like width and positioning to make responsive.
Images for the project were sourced from #pexels.com
The live site can be found on netlify @ https://mytrillo-booking.netlify.app
